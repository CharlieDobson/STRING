# STRING
Digital Mars custom STRING class.

The Digital Mars compiler (DMC) was written to the C89 standard with limited support for C++ (pre-C++98).
As such, DMC does not support the C++ string class from the standard template library, nor can it easily do string concantenation.
This class was written to ease the use of working with character arrays and character pointers and has only been tested with DMC.
